# Tanks Game

### Development

```bash
npm install 
npm run dev
```

### Start Game
```bash
node dist/main.js
```

#### Auto Mode
We can run the application in auto mode, where game will be played automatically. This is only for testing the workflow of game. To enable auto mode, set `AUTO_RUN=true` in config.js/config.ts.  
If you are running application without setting up typescript, you can make the above change in config.js.  
If you are a developer, set it in config.ts.
